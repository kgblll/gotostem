		                <p>Skool is an independent Hungarian nonprofit initiative dedicated to educate, inspire and motivate girls in the field of technology.  Skool’s mission is to contribute to a social change: to close the gender gap by having more women technology creators. With its fun, engaging and student-centered activities, workshops, after-school courses, summer camps and soft-skill trainings, Skool equips girls between the age of 10-18 with the skills and resources required to explore their options and career possibilities in technology.</p>
				<p>Skool is bringing tried-and-tested, successful and innovative ways and methods to the project on teaching and inspiring the young to be more attracted to technology careers. Skool places a strong emphasis on industry engagement to connect the young to the real life work challenges and opportunities. Skool has worked with over 20 technology partners in Hungary, including Microsoft, Prezi, Google, Facebook, as well as 180 volunteers who are mainly tech developers and thus role models for the girls. </p>
				<p>Skool’s sister company, KódGarázs runs 10 week courses which offer both boys and girls the opportunity to learn more about programming in a similar fun and child-focused way.
</p>
				<p>Key person involved in the project:</p>
				<p>Zsófi Major is the Founder of Skool and is responsible amongst others for international projects and partnerships. Zsófi has a strong experience working with international and multi-disciplinary projects, ensuring coordinated and integrated working processes across countries and multi-functional programmes. Zsófi has been involved in several events, roundtables and presentations in Hungary about educating and empowering young girls towards technology.</p>

		                <p>VHTO aims to increase the participation of girls and women in science, engineering and technology (STEM) in the Netherlands. VHTO initiates and executes a wide range of projects and activities, from primary education through the labour market. VHTO activities are based on results of national and international research. Research has shown that it is not due to a lack of ability that girls opt out for STEM/ICT, but lack of role models, lack of support from teachers and parents and simply not being well informed about future education or job opportunities in STEM and computer sciences.</p>
				<p>Female STEM professionals and students play an important role in boosting the involvement of girls and women in STEM. As role models they can show the broad range of STEM-study programs and professions, demonstrate that they enjoy their work and that it fits their aspirations and attainment. They support the growth of girls’ self-confidence and interest in STEM-related subjects. The support of female professionals as role models is integrated in many of VHTO’s activities. The women who participate signed up for the role-model data base Spiegelbeeld (“Mirror Image”) in which more than 2000 female STEM professionals and students participate.</p>
				<p>Key persons involved in the project:</p>
				<p>Cornelia Booij (MA) is the managing director of VHTO. Over the years mrs. Booij has been a member of various governmental and EU expertgroups, advisory panels and committee’s on the subject of girls and women in STEM and computer sciences (IT). She has given many speeches and teacher-training programmes on this subject for different audiences, nationally and internationally.</p>
				<p>Esther van Schaik has a degree in educational sciences and is policy advisor of VHTO and coordinates the European funded projects. She is skilled in working on a variety of EU projects, reporting to a variety of funding bodies. In addition Esther is the contact person of VHTO  for two European networks:  The European Association for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (<a href="http://www.witec-eu.net/">http://www.witec-eu.net/</a>) and The European Centre for Women and Technology (<a href="http://www.womenandtechnology.eu">http://www.womenandtechnology.eu</a>)</p>
